        A few years ago, a friend's band asked if I could shoot a music video.
        I said yes, even though I'd never filmed one before. I knew
        photography and loved light, so I figured I'd learn by doing. Since
        then, we've made five videos together â€” one shot entirely on iPhone
        and animated with AI. I'm always up for projects that push boundaries
        and force me to create in ways I haven't before.

        Here is a short reel exploring some of that work
